#To start with, we need a basic map of the study area
data("wrld_simpl")#this dataset is within the library maptools
plot(wrld_simpl)#this is a shapefile with all countries

#Make a subset with relevant countries:

#We will use Worldclim, which is easy to download directly in R:

#Worldclim data is described here: https://worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html
#We can plot individual variables to see how they look. 
#To start, we will use annual mean temperature (bio1), temperature seasonality (bio4)
#annual precipitation (bio12) and precipitation seasonality (bio15)
# (later on, we will select variables using a statistical method)

#We should cut the climate layers to correspond to our study area:

#look at the maps again:
